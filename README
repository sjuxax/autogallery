WHAT IT IS:
-----------------------

autogallery is a simple Python experiment to easily create accessible galleries out of folders full of files.

REQUIREMENTS:
-----------------------

Python >= 2.5
Python Imaging Library

Python 2.5 or greater should work, but only Python 2.6 is tested.

USAGE:
-----------------------

--regen
	Regenerate image thumbnails and zip

--rex
	Extract the contents of supportfiles.tar.bz2 again

--regenall
	Do both --rex and --regen.

Steps:

1. Copy autogallery.py and supportfiles.tar.bz2 to a directory with images in it
2. Run autogallery.py
3. Hit the directory you extracted into /index.html and enjoy your pictures. :)

Simply copy the script and the tarball of its support files to a folder full of images, and execute python autogallery.py from that directory. A webpage will automatically be generated and ready to send out to friends. : )

To change configuration options, change options in supportfiles/config.cfg and re-run autogallery.py.

ROADMAP/OVERVIEW:
-----------------------

There's a lot left to be done here; this was a novelty script written about a year ago (July 2008) as an experiment with Python. The code has been revised a few times since then, but surely needs much more help and revision.

AutoGallery was designed with extensibility and customizability in mind. We're using a templating setup and the tarballed support files for easy distribution of customized things; you don't have to use the (plain, gaunt) default index page if you don't want to. The hooks to add to your layout will eventually be documented here.
